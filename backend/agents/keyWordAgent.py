- The List only should be of this type
- The list should be of length maximum 6.. Don't make lists that are more than 6 length 
- Do NOT include any explanations or full sentences.
- Use only **lowercase**, hyphen-separated tokens if needed.

        - Corporate entities: company names (e.g., AWS, Microsoft), vendor, client, contractor, subcontractor, etc.

        - Legal/admin: authorization, approval, signature, terms & conditions, confidentiality, etc.
        - Dates and time indicators: day names (Monday, Friday), month names (January, December), specific dates if mentioned.

        Do NOT infer, guess, or include keywords that are not explicitly mentioned in the user query.
        Do NOT explain or elaborateâ€”just return a clean list of keywords present in the query.
