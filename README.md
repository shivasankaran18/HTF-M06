# 🧠 HTF-M06 — AI-Powered Document Intelligence System

Welcome to the repository for **HTF-M06**, an intelligent agentic system designed to extract relevant answers from large collections of unstructured documents such as PDFs, reports, invoices, and policy files.

This project leverages LLM-based agents, embeddings, reinforcement learning, and Redis-backed storage to deliver **accurate, feedback-driven document query resolution**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **User Query Handling**: Accepts freeform user queries.
  
- 🤖 **Autogen Agents**:
  
  - `Prompting Agent`: Refines queries based on feedback.
  
  - `Keyword Extraction Agent`: Pulls key topics from improved queries.
  
  - `Details Extraction Agent`: Analyzes documents and composes answers.
  
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Embeds and compares document topics using `Gemma 2B` (via Ollama).
  
- 🧠 **RL-based Document Ranking**: Trains a neural policy model to learn better file ranking from feedback.
  
- ⚡ **Redis Integration**: Stores file-topic pairs and supports fast lookup without traditional vector DBs.
  
- 📄 **PDF Parsing**: Converts unstructured PDF documents into searchable text chunks.
